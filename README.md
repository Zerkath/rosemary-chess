# Rosemary Chess Engine
This engine was made during Artificial Intelligence and Robotics course in Karelia University of Applied Sciences.

The purpose of the project was to learn about use cases of artificial intelligence. Programming was usually done in pairs, commits don't directly show the effort of contributors.

## Technology
The project was made using Java 11, other versions might work too.

Testing is done with Junit 5.

To work with GUI's the jar needed to be turned into a exe, this was done using http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

## Other info
The program communicates with chess GUI's using UCI protocol.
